SeisMan's Blog
##############

Hi, I am SeisMan, *a man learning seismology*.

This is my personal blog. It is also called SeisMan, which represents *seismological manual*.
It focuses on basics and advances on seismology, softwares like GMT, SAC, and
also programming languages and tools to solve seismological problems.

It is a non-profit, technology-oriented blog. I hope it is useful for most
Chinese students majoring in seismology.
